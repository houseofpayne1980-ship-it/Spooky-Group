# Security Policy

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. Create a private issue and label it `security` OR contact repo maintainers directly.
2. If you prefer, email the maintainers (add an email here) with the subject "Security vulnerability in Spooky-Group".

We recommend repository admins enable GitHub's secret scanning and Dependabot alerts in the repository settings (Security > Code security & analysis).
